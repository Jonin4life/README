Information about Me
My name is Jonin4life and I am currently working to become a software developer. I will be using this github to keep my projects organized and together for 
future reference and potential job applications.

My current education goals are:
1. Finish my Bachelors in Computer Science
2. Complete the courses available at https://www.freecodecamp.org
3. Complete the CS50 course and earn the certificate from https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/

I have some familiarity with C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, and Python but do not feel that I am proficient in any of these languages.

I am casually studying Spanish, Japanese, and Gaeilge (Irish) in my free time as a passion/hobby.  
I am not fluent in these languages, but I do enjoy studying them.
